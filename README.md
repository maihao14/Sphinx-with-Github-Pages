# Sphinx-with-Github-Pages
Sphinx-with-Github-Pages was born from the need for developers who are not documenting specialists to easily, quickly, and independently build their documentation via Sphinx.

## Introduction
Sphinx-with-Github-Pages is a tutorial Python package to teach you quick start Sphinx documenting in a single place â€” so you can focus on building the next big thing. This package helps all levels of Python developers and researchers for building their own Sphinx documentation and can be used through an interactive command-line interface (i.e. MacOS terminal or Windows command-line consoles) with little knowledge of Python.

Installation, Usage, documentation and scripts are described at

## Installation

### Conda environment

We recommend creating a custom
[conda environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
where `Sphinx-with-Github-Pages` can be installed along with its dependencies.

- Create a environment called `sphinx` :

```bash
conda create -n sphinx python=3.8 -c conda-forge
```

- Activate the newly created environment:

```bash
conda activate sphinx
```

### Installing

mkdir ~/DocsWorkFolder
cd DocsWorkFolder
```

Run `sphinx-quickstart`:

```bash
sphinx-quickstart
```

A `sphinx-quickstart` welcome interface will be loading:
